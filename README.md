# NOOBLANG interpreter written in Rust (not blazingly fast)

## The Perfect (Esoteric) Programming Language for Beginners
- (Almost) no symbols
- ~~No confusing `for`, `while` loops, functions~~
- ~~No fancy data structures (`arrays` etc.)~~
- ~~No variable scoping rules and stuff~~
- Everything done with `if`s and procedures (`repeat`ing lines of code)

## Example
NOOBLANG program to print prime numbers between 0 and 100:
```
x be 2
prime be yes
y be 1
y be y plus 1
run 8 to 11 if y is x
prime be no if x mod y is 0
run 4 to 7
write x if prime 
x be x plus 1
end if x atleast 100
run 2 to 11

```
